\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:introduction}
This portfolio was created to display my skills as a computer scientist and to
showcase some of my work. In it you will find several examples of programs and
descriptions of what I have learned. I believe this portfolio provides a good 
introduction to my abilities and what I have learned at Western. It is provided
for the convinience of future employers.
\section{Portfolio Organization}
The remainder of this portfolio is organized as follows. Chapter~\ref{chap:slos}
presents the student learning objectives on which this portfolio focuses. These 
objectives currently include: Systems. Expect this section to expand as I 
progress through my major. Chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion} contains a summary of 
what this portfolio includes with some concluding remarks.
