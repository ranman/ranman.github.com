\chapter{Student Learning Objectives}\label{chap:slos}
This chapter consists of two major sections.  Section~\ref{sect:technicalSkills}
focuses on the technical skills you have learned during my time here at
Western.  Section~\ref{sect:socialSkills} focuses on the skills I have
acquired that are non-technical. The social skills section mainly focuses on my ethics course and my technical skills section focuses mainly on CS350.

\section{Technical Skills}\label{sect:technicalSkills}
By ``technical skills'' I mean not just programming languages, but paradigms, algorithms, and engineering methodologies that differentiate a good programmer from a hobbyist. Included in this section are three SLOs: Software Engineering, Algorithms, and Systems. Though at this time I've completed only Systems. The other sections will be filled as I progress through my major.

\section{Social Skills}\label{sect:socialSkills}
By ``social skills'' I mean the ability to communicate effectively both in a technical setting and a non technical setting. This section includes three SLOs: Communication, Teamwork, and Ethics. Though at this time I've only completed Ethics. The other sections will be filled as I progress through my major.
