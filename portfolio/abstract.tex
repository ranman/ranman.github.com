\chapter*{Abstract}\label{abstract}
This portfolio is a collection of the work I've done in Computer Science while attending WCU. I'm writing this so that prospective employers might see examples of my work and have a good understanding of what I'm capable of. Contained within this profile are examples of my work from CS 350 and CS 370. To date I have done several low level assignments for the Systems SLO. At WCU I've learned several things so far including: the importance of well engineered software; the ethics behind programming; the privacy laws and intellectual property laws programmers should be aware of; what is essential for system programming; how low level systems work; and finally the strengths of linux tools and how to use them.
