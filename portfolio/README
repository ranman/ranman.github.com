===============================================================================
This is the LaTeX template for the Computer Science Portfolio.  The document
is broken down into a set of individual files to make things easier to work
with.  Here are the files of interest:


./portfolio.tex
---------------
This is the main document of the portfolio.  There's not a lot that you need
to do here.  You do need to fill in some variables (i.e., your name, when
you plan to graduate, which instructor taught each of your courses).  If you
want to add some appendices, you'll need to add them here.


./abstract.tex
--------------
This file will contain the abstract for your document.  See the contents of
the file for a brief description of what it should contain.


./introduction.tex
------------------
This file will contain the introduction to your entire portfolio.  See the
contents of the file for a brief description of what it should contain.


./studentLearningObjectives.tex
-------------------------------
This file sets of the chapter on the Student Learning Objectives.  It includes
several other files.  You'll need to write a few sentences in this file to set
the scene for the reset of the material, but the majority of the SLOs material
will be in the files that follow.

If you have not taken some of the courses that bring in some SLOs, you can edit
this file to comment out the include of the others.  For example, if the only
class you've taken is Software Engineering, you might comment out the include
of the algorithms, systems, and ethics sections.


./SLOs/softwareEngineering.tex
------------------------------
This file contains the write-up for the software engineering SLO.


./SLOs/algorithms.tex
---------------------
This file contains the write-up for the algorithms SLO.


./SLOs/systems.tex
------------------
This file contains the write-up for the systems SLO.


./SLOs/communication.tex
------------------------
This file contains the write-up for the communication SLO.


./SLOs/teamwork.tex
-------------------
This file contains the write-up for the teamwork SLO.


./SLOs/ethics.tex
-----------------
This file contains the write-up for the ethics SLO.


./appendices/appendixA.tex
--------------------------
This is a sample appendix that shows how you can put long source listings
in the document.  You may need to add additional files like this for other
appendices.  If you do add them, you'll need to add them to the end of
portfolio.tex.


./conclusions.tex
-----------------
This file will contain the conclusion to your entire portfolio.  See the
contents of the file for a brief description of what it should contain.


./bibliography.bib
------------------
This file contains a set of 'BibTeX' entries.  These represent things that
you want to show up in the Bibliography of the document.  There's an example
in the file.  You cite things in there using the \cite{} command -- there's
an example in the document that does that too.


./WcuPortfolio.cls
------------------
Don't touch this file.


./consent.tex
-------------
Don't touch this file.


./figures/
----------
This is a directory that contains figures.  Having figures in a separate
directory just keeps things from getting too cluttered here.


./workSamples/
--------------
This is a directory that contains work samples.  Having work samples in a
separate directory just keeps things from getting too cluttered here.


./Makefile
----------
If you work on your portfolio in a non-Windows OS, this will help you build
your project.  Just type 'make' on the command line and, if there are no
syntax errors in your files, this will build portfolio.pdf for you.
'make clean' will clean things up for you.
